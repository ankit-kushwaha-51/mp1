# File Paths in Linux

* A file path is the human-readable representation of a file or folderâ€™s location on a computer 
* Files and folders on are given names containing the usual components like the letters, numbers, and other characters on a keyboard
* But when a file is inside a folder, or a folder is inside another folder, the / character shows the relationship between them
* The forward slashes indicate that one item is stored inside of the item preceding it
* An **absolute path** is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). An absolute path is a complete path from start of actual file system from / directory.
* **Relative path** is defined as the path related to the *present working directly(pwd)*. It starts at your current directory and never starts with a /
