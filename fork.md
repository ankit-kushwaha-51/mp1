## Fork

* A **Fork** is creating your own [repository](repository.md) by [branching](branch.md) off of an existing one. 
* It is different from [cloning](clone.md) because it allows you to contribute to the original repository via pull requests.
* To create a fork of a repo, you can click on the Fork button on the page of the repository, in Github

* After forking a repo, you would normally clone it onto your local, and then you can contribute on it, [commit](commit.md) your changes, and then send pull requests to the original repo author.
