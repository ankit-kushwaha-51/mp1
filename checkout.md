## Checkout

* A **Checkout** lets you switch which [branch](branch.md) you are currently working on.
* In order to use the checkout command, type git checkout and then the name of the branch you want to switch to.
* In git, the checkout command can also be done on [commits](commit.md), and files, in addition to branches.
* Fun fact: In order to create a new branch and checkout on it in one command, type git checkout -b and then your new branch's name.
