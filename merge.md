## Merge

* A **Merge** lets you integrate changes on one [branch](branch.md) onto another.
* First, it is importante to git [checkout](checkout.md) on the branch which you want to incorporate the other branch into
* Once you are sure you are checked out in the correct branch, you can type git [merge](merge.md), and put the name of the branch whose changes you want to merge into your checked out branch.
* Assuming there are no merge conflicts, you should then see the checked out branch have all the commits of the branch you just merged
