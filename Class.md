## Class

* Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. 
* In the case of an animal, we could create an Animal() class to track properties about the Animal like the name and age.
* It’s important to note that a class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. 
* The Animal() class may specify that the name and age are necessary for defining an animal, but it will not actually state what a specific animal’s name or age is.
