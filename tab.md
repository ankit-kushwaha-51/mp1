# Using the tab key to complete file paths

* In the Bash shell, the **Tab** key means autocomplete
* For example, to type an image.jpg fileâ€™s location, you can start with *$ ~/Pi* and then press the **Tab** key
* As long as there is only one item starting with Pi, the folder Pictures autocompletes for you
* If there are two or more items starting with the letters you attempt to autocomplete, then Bash displays what those items are
* You manually type more until you reach a unique string that the shell can safely autocomplete
