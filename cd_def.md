* To change the current working directory, we can use the **cd** command (where "cd" stands for **change directory**).
* For example, to move one directory upwards (into the current folder's parent folder), you can just call:
* cd ..
* To move into subfolders, you would call something like this:
* cd name-of-subfolder/sub-subfolder/
