# cd (change directory)


* To change the current working directory, we can use the **cd** command (where "cd" stands for **change directory**).
* For example, to move one directory upwards (into the current folder's parent folder), you can just call:

![Image of cd](/images![Image of cd]

* To move into subfolders, you would call something like this:

![Image of cd2](/images/cd2.png)
