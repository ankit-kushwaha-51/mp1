## Branch

* A **Branch** is a version of the [repository](repository.md) that diverges from the main work.
* Branches can be a new version of a repository, experimental changes, or personal [forks](fork.md) of a repository for users to alter and test changes.
* You can [merge](merge.md) branches to combine their changes into one.
* Typing git branch will show all the branches that are currently created in your project. 
* The branch you are currently at will be highlighted in green.
