## Push

* A **Push** is used to transfer the changes made to your local repository, which is on your computer, onto your remote repository, which is on GitHub.
* Your repo's name on GitHub is usually origin, so you type git push origin master to push onto your GitHub's master branch for the project
* If you forked a repo, then you can also add the original repository as a remote repo using remote add. Once you add the remote repo, you can then push into this repo as well using git push and then the remote repo name, slash, branch name.
* Note: Before you can push your changes, you need to do git add and git commit first.
