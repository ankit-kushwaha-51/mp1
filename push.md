## Push

* A **Push** is used to transfer the changes made to your local [repository](repository.md), which is on your computer, onto your remote repository, which is on GitHub.
* Your repo's name on GitHub is usually origin, so you type git push origin master to push onto your GitHub's master branch for the project
* If you [forked](fork.md) a repo, then you can also add the original repository as a remote repo using remote add. Once you add the remote repo, you can then push into this repo as well using git push.
* Note: Before you can push your changes, you need to do git add and git [commit](commit.md) first.
