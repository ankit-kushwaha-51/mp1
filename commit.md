## Commit

* A **Commit** is needed after changes are made on your local to the [repo](repository.md). This is so that the changes that are made can be [pushed](push.md) to the repo. 
* When you want to commit, you type the command git commit -m and add a message in quotations. The message is generally some text which tells what the changes made are.
* Before you commit, you have to do git add in order to add the file that you made the change to.
