## Commit

* A **Commit** is needed after changes are made on your local to the repo. This is so that the changes that are made can be pushed to the repo. 
* When you want to commit, you type the command git commit -m and add a message in quotations. The message is generally some text which tells what the changes made are.
* Before you commit, you have to do git add in order to add the file that you made the change to.

* Branches can have multiple commits on them. 
* Fun fact: More advanced git users can use the command git cherry-pick to navigate commits on a branch, and move a specific commit onto a branch.
