# Continuous integration

It is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository several times a day which supports integrating new functionality with the existing code. This integrated code also ensures that there are no errors in the runtime environment, allowing us to check how it reacts with other changes.

Dockers help developers to build their code and test their code in any environment to catch bugs early in the application development life cycle. Dockers help streamline the process, save time on builds, and allows developers to run tests in parallel.
Dockers can integrate with source control management tools like GitHub and Integration tools like Jenkins. Developers submit the code into GitHub, test the code that automatically triggers a build using Jenkins creating an image. This image can be added to Docker registry to deal with inconsistencies between different environment types.

This results in consistency in the development of software in organizations and help build software in a fast manner increasing productivity and competitiveness.
